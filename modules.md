Below is your modular garden plan—with sun/shade and water/dry tolerance notes added for each crop. All modules are designed for raised, wheeled beds or containers outfitted with deep water reservoirs and wicking materials for a self-watering ecosystem. You can still adjust water delivery (or add drainage if needed) to suit the individual preferences noted below.

---

## Module A: Leafy Greens & Root Combo  
**Crops:** Lettuce (Romaine & Iceberg), Carrots, Chives, Parsley

- **Lettuce (Romaine & Iceberg):**  
  - **Sun:** Performs best in full sun in cooler climates; in hotter regions, benefits from partial shade (morning sun with afternoon shade).  
  - **Water:** Requires consistent moisture (moderately thirsty).  

- **Carrots:**  
  - **Sun:** Thrive in full sun to light partial shade.  
  - **Water:** Enjoy steady, even moisture—not drought tolerant.  

- **Chives:**  
  - **Sun:** Prefer full sun.  
  - **Water:** Do well with moderate moisture.

- **Parsley:**  
  - **Sun:** Adapts to full sun or partial shade.  
  - **Water:** Prefers consistent moisture.

*Note:* The self-watering system should maintain the steady moisture these crops need, but in very hot conditions consider adding a light afternoon shade for the lettuce.

## Module B: Sweet Potato & Herb Patch  
**Crops:** Sweet Potatoes, Oregano, Thyme

- **Sweet Potatoes:**  
  - **Sun:** Require full sun for robust tuber development.  
  - **Water:** Need consistent moisture (moderately thirsty) but ensure the soil isn’t waterlogged.

- **Oregano:**  
  - **Sun:** Thrives in full sun.  
  - **Water:** Drought tolerant—prefers a drier environment once established.

- **Thyme:**  
  - **Sun:** Loves full sun.  
  - **Water:** Very drought tolerant; does best in well-drained soils and can handle less moisture.

*Tip:* Since sweet potatoes need regular moisture but oregano and thyme favor drier conditions, you may adjust the local watering around the herbs (or use a barrier) if you notice excess dampness around them.

## Module C: Vertical Green Bean Trellis  
**Crops:** Green Beans, Rosemary, Parsley

- **Green Beans:**  
  - **Sun:** Need full sun for optimal growth.  
  - **Water:** Are quite thirsty—demand consistent moisture.

- **Rosemary:**  
  - **Sun:** Prefers full sun.  
  - **Water:** Drought tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils.

- **Parsley:**  
  - **Sun:** Grows well in full sun to partial shade.  
  - **Water:** Requires regular moisture.

*Tip:* The self-watering system is ideal here for the thirsty green beans, while rosemary’s drought tolerance means it’s forgiving if the moisture is slightly higher than its preferred level.

---

## Module D: Container Yellow Squash  
**Crop:** Yellow Squash

- **Yellow Squash:**  
  - **Sun:** Demands full sun (at least 6–8 hours daily).  
  - **Water:** Very thirsty—requires ample, consistent moisture.

- **Trellising:** Use a trellis to train the vines vertically, which also improves air circulation and sun exposure.

*Note:* Monitor the container’s water levels to ensure that this water-hungry plant gets plenty of moisture without becoming waterlogged.

## Module E: Broccoli & Companion Herbs  
**Crops:** Broccoli, Thyme, Rosemary, Oregano, (Optional: Parsley)

- **Broccoli:**  
  - **Sun:** Prefers full sun to partial shade (partial shade can help in very hot climates).  
  - **Water:** Needs consistent moisture (moderately thirsty).

- **Thyme:**  
  - **Sun:** Thrives in full sun.  
  - **Water:** Drought tolerant.

- **Rosemary:**  
  - **Sun:** Loves full sun.  
  - **Water:** Very drought tolerant.

- **Oregano:**  
  - **Sun:** Prefers full sun.  
  - **Water:** Drought tolerant once established.

- **Parsley (Optional):**  
  - **Sun:** Adapts to full sun or partial shade.  
  - **Water:** Requires consistent moisture.

*Tip:* The mix here creates a balance: broccoli needs regular water while the herbs (thyme, rosemary, oregano) enjoy a drier spot—just keep an eye on moisture levels near the base of broccoli plants.

## Module F: Pepper Patch  
**Crops:** Bell Peppers & Other Peppers, Basil (including Dark Opal), Oregano, Parsley, (Optional: Chives, Garlic)

- **Peppers (Bell & Other Varieties):**  
  - **Sun:** Require full sun for best fruit production.  
  - **Water:** Need consistent moisture (moderately thirsty).

- **Basil (including Dark Opal):**  
  - **Sun:** Loves full sun.  
  - **Water:** Thirsty—needs regular watering.

- **Oregano:**  
  - **Sun:** Prefers full sun.  
  - **Water:** Drought tolerant; thrives with less water once established.

- **Parsley:**  
  - **Sun:** Grows well in full sun to partial shade.  
  - **Water:** Prefers consistent moisture.

- **Chives (Optional):**  
  - **Sun:** Best in full sun.  
  - **Water:** Do well with moderate moisture.

- **Garlic (Optional):**  
  - **Sun:** Requires full sun.  
  - **Water:** Prefers moderate moisture with good drainage.

*Tip:* Adjust watering around the oregano to prevent it from becoming too wet while still satisfying the more moisture-needy basil and peppers.

### General Considerations  
- **Sun Exposure:** Most vegetables here thrive in full sun, though some (like lettuce and broccoli) can benefit from partial shade in extremely hot climates.  
- **Water Needs:** The self-watering system is excellent for maintaining consistent moisture for thirsty crops (like green beans, yellow squash, basil, and peppers), while the drier-tolerant herbs (oregano, thyme, rosemary) can handle slightly less water.  
- **Balancing Microenvironments:** When planting together in a self-watering module, consider the natural water needs of each plant; slight adjustments or physical barriers can help prevent overwatering for drought-tolerant herbs.
