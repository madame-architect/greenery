Below is a sample modular garden plan that lets you “mix‐and‐match” your vegetables in small, defined spaces. Each module is designed to encourage beneficial companion interactions while keeping things compact and easy to manage. Feel free to adjust dimensions (raised beds, containers, or designated ground plots) to suit your available space!

## Module Overview

### **Module A: Leafy Greens & Root Combo**  
**Primary Crops:**  
- **Lettuce** (Romaine & Iceberg)

**Companions:**  
- **Carrots:** Sown in the gaps between lettuce to help break up compacted soil.  
- **Edge Herbs:** Chives and Parsley planted along the perimeter help repel pests while lending a nice aromatic boost.

**Design Tips:**  
- Use a 4×4-foot raised bed or container.  
- Ensure even spacing so that lettuce gets enough sunlight while carrots can develop freely.

### **Module B: Sweet Potato & Herb Patch**  
**Primary Crop:**  
- **Sweet Potatoes:** Plant densely on the ground (or in a large container if preferred) to allow vines to spread.

**Companions:**  
- **Oregano & Thyme:** These low-growing, ground-hugging herbs not only help suppress weeds but also deter pests that might be attracted to sweet potatoes.

**Design Tips:**  
- Consider a deep container or dedicated garden bed where the tubers have plenty of room to spread.  
- Provide a light mulch to retain moisture and reduce weeds.

### **Module C: Vertical Green Bean Trellis**  
**Primary Crop:**  
- **Green Beans:** Grow these vertically using a sturdy trellis for support.

**Companions:**  
- **Rosemary & Parsley:** These herbs placed at the base can improve flavor and ward off bean pests.  
- **Avoid:** Garlic and chives in this module, as they can inhibit bean growth.

**Design Tips:**  
- Use a tall, narrow bed or container with an integrated trellis.  
- Maintain consistent watering to keep the vines healthy.

### **Module D: Container Yellow Squash**  
**Primary Crop:**  
- **Yellow Squash:** Grow these in a container where you can train the vines vertically with a trellis.

**Design Tips:**  
- Choose a container with good drainage and ample space for the vines to climb.  
- Regularly check the trellis to guide the growth and prevent sprawling.

---

### **Module E: Broccoli & Companion Herbs**  
**Primary Crop:**  
- **Broccoli:** Best grown in cooler conditions, so plan for partial shade if needed.

**Companions:**  
- **Herbs such as Thyme, Rosemary, and Oregano:** These aromatic herbs can help repel common broccoli pests.  
- **Optional Edge:** Parsley may also be interplanted along the borders.

**Design Tips:**  
- Space broccoli plants about 18–24 inches apart.  
- A 4×4-foot bed works well—just be sure to give each plant room to mature.

---

### **Module F: Pepper Patch (Bell & Other Peppers)**  
**Primary Crops:**  
- **Bell Peppers and Other Pepper Varieties:** Plant together since their cultural requirements are very similar.

**Companions:**  
- **Basil (including Dark Opal):** Enhances flavor and repels pests.  
- **Oregano & Parsley:** Useful border plants that improve overall plant health.  
- **Optional:** Chives and Garlic can be added in moderation, but make sure they’re not too dense so as not to compete for nutrients.

**Design Tips:**  
- Use a raised bed or large container with full sun and well-draining soil.  
- Space pepper plants about 18 inches apart to allow for air circulation and growth.

## Additional General Tips

- **Sun & Soil:** All modules should be positioned so that sun-loving crops (peppers, squash, and beans) receive full sun, while cooler-season crops (broccoli and leafy greens) can benefit from partial afternoon shade if necessary.
- **Rotation & Maintenance:** With a modular system, you can rotate modules seasonally to help manage soil fertility and reduce pest buildup.
- **Watering:** Use a consistent watering schedule—containers may require more frequent watering than ground beds.
- **Inter-module Interaction:** If you have pathways between modules, consider planting pest-repelling herbs (like rosemary or extra basil) in those strips to further protect your crops.

This modular design allows you to grow your veggies in a systematic way, keeping companion plants nearby to enhance growth, repel pests, and maximize your garden’s productivity. Enjoy planning and planting your garden!
